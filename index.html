Greetings from the Woods Quad! We are a diverse population of squirrels that work hard to keep up the spriits of the students, faculty, and staff at the University of Alabama.
Our skills include, but are not limited to: tree climbing, scampering, staring intently, stealing, gatherer of Russell's peanuts, balancing on ledges. 
Work that we pride ourselve in includes unsettling many students, looking cute.
